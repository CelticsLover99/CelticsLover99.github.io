      <div class="About2">I am currently 13 years old and I was born in New Delhi, India where I lived for the first six years of my life. After that, my family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands where I went to the International School of Amsterdam (ISA) for four years and am now studying at The American School of the Hague. In addition to being an active contributor and learner in my school environment, I currently participate in many extracurricular activities across multiple areas of interest. On the athletics front, I play for BS Leiden, one of the Netherlands’ largest basketball clubs, and I recently represented my school’s soccer team in the International Schools Sports Tournament in Vienna, Austria. In addition to playing sports, I have coded this website using three different languages – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – and I continue to challenge myself to learn other coding languages. In my free time, I play the clarinet and I am currently preparing four musical pieces, including one composed by Mozart to perform at an upcoming concert. I find that my extracurricular activities re-energize me and provide me with a sense of accomplishment. Thus, I created this website to help you understand the person I am outside of school and the various activities I am proud of participating in. Please use the buttons above to navigate through my website. Enjoy!

<!--Scratch Section----->
  <div class="Scratch">
    <div style = "font-size: 20px; color: #eba937de"><u>Scratch</u></div>
    <div class="Intro">I first started coding by learning how to operate Scratch to build projects. With the help of Juni and my Juni instructor, I mastered the motion, looks, sounds, events, controls, sensors, variables, and 'my blocks'. I learned scratch through the organized lessons of Juni and by viewing other scratchers' work on the main page. During the two years I spent learning scratch, I coded many projects and a short explanation of a few of them are shown below.</div>

    <div class="Project1">The first project is one of the master projects that I coded. A master project is a project which makes you code a game based on the skills you have learned during the course. This project is an interactive 2 v. 2 games based on soccer. The controls to move the sprites (characters) are below:
      Ben (sprite dressed in red and black): Arrow Key
      Hannah (sprite with brunnete hair, dressed in white tank top and blue baggy shorts): WASD keys
      Avery (sprite dressed in dark blue top and khaki cargo pants): IJKL keys
      Jordyn (sprite dressed in teel and pink soccer unifrom):TFGH keys

    <div class = Intro>After Scratch, I started to learn how to code in Python. I spent two years learning python, through levels one and two. A few of my master projects as well as my projects are listed below. </div>
    <div class = 'Project 1'>The first master project I created was a remake of the Squid Game. In this game, one controls the green triangle and aims to reach the multicolored square before the red circles touch the triangle. If the green triangle is touched by the red circles, they lose one life. I hope you enjoy playing this game.</div>

    </div>

    <div class = 'Project 1'>The second master project I created was a Tricky Trivia game. This game was based in the 'console' section, meaning it was without any type of visuals. The game asks the user randomized tricky questions and the final score is based on the number of correct questions the user answered. At the end, there is an option of extra credit questions which are questions with increased difficulty and can be used to get a better score. Have fun!</div>

    <div class = 'Project 1'>Advanced Blackjack is the third project I worked on during my two years learning python. Similar to the previous project, this one was also built in the 'console' section. The purpose of this game is to be closer to 21 than the dealer, while not going over the limit of 21. The game repeats infinetly until the user stops the game. This was quite a unique game and I hope you enjoy playing it! </div>

    <div class = 'Project 1'>To start the list, the first project listed is titled 'Pattern Printing'. In this project, I practiced making repeated patterns using the Pac-Man icon. The repeated pattern increases by one as it goes on.</div>
