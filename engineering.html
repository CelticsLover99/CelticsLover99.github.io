<div class = "Designing_Solutions_Intro">In school, one of my favorite classes is Designing Solutions. In this class, we are assigned with coming up with solutions to real-world problems. After being given a problem to fix, we then come up with a preliminary idea and make an annotated concept drawing (a representation of the solution with labels, materials, and other information). Last semester, my teacher assigned three problems for me to solve. My unique solutions for each of them are shown below. </div>

<div class = "Bumblebee">The first problem I had to solve was creating a shelter for buff-tailed bumblebees, one where they will be safe from habitat loss, disease, and any possible predators. Thus, I created the Tri-nest.  The Tri-Nest has three levels; the balcony (top level), the bumble houses (middle level), and the food tubs (lowest level). The balcony provides a space for bumblebees to relax, while shielding them from rain. The Bumblebee houses are wood cubes with deep holes drilled into them; giving the bumblebees a cozy place to sleep and stay for the night. Finally, the food tubs contain sugar water, a particular food for bumblebees to provide them with the necessary nutrients. When I began this project, I started researching about them to emphasize for their situation. Next, using this information, I created two detailed design drawings and chose the tri-nest to solve the main problem. After that, I started building the tri-nest mainly using wood and 3D prints. Following this, after receiving feedback from my thinking partner, I modified my design solution to further fit the end goal. Finally, I shared this masterpiece with the class. If I were to continue building this, I would aim to design and build better housing for the bumblebees and try to add containers for different types of food.es
