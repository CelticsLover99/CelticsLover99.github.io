      <div class="About2">My name is Anuraag Dhaul, and I am currently 12 years old. I was born in New Delhi, India and lived there for the first six years of my life. After that, my family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands. In the Netherlands, I went to the Internation School of Amsterdam (ISA) and am now studying at The American School of the Hague. My hobbies are football, basketball, reading mystery novels. When I grow up, I want to be a businessman or a lawyer. I created this website to show you about my accomplishemnts and my goals in life.

  <div class="Scratch">
    <div class="Intro">I first started coding by learning how to operate Scratch to build projects. With the help of Juni and my Juni instructor I mastered the motion, looks, sounds, events, controls, sensors, variables, and 'my blocks'. I learned scratch through the organized lessons of Juni and by viewing other scratchers' work on the main page. During the two years I spent learning scratch, I coded many projects. Some of these projects and and a short explanation of each one of them are below.</div>

    <div class="Project1">The first project is one of my master projects that I coded. A master project is a project which makes you code a game based on the skills you have learned during the course. This project is an interactive 2 v. 2 games based on soccer. The controls to move the sprites (characters) are below:
      Ben (sprite dressed in red and black): Arrow Key
      Hannah (sprite with brunnete hair, dressed in white tank top and blue baggy shorts): WASD keys
      Avery (sprite dressed in dark blue top and khaki cargo pants): IJKL keys
      Jordyn (sprite dressed in teel and pink soccer unifrom):TFGH keys

    <div class = "Project1">The second project I created during my time learning Scratch was a 'Person v. AI' game based around on Tennis. This game replays the match between Federer and Herbert (two major tennis champions). The controls are listed in the project page. Enjoy!

  <div class = "Python">
    <div class = Intro>After Scratch, throught the help and guidance of Juni, I started to learn how to code in Python. I spent two years learning python, through levels one and two. A few of my master projects as well as my projects are listed below. </div>
    <div class = 'Project 1'>The first master project I created was a remake of the Squid Game. In this game, one controls the green triangle and aims to reach the multicolored square before the red circles touch the triangle. If one is touched by the red circles, they lose one life. I hope you enjoy playing this game.</div>

    </div>

    <div class = 'Project 1'>The second master project I created was a Tricky Trivia game. This game was based in the 'console' section, meaning it was without any type of visuals. The game asks the user randomized tricky questions and the final score is based on the number of correct questions the user answered. At the end, there is an option of extra credit questions which are questions with increased difficulty and can be used to get a better score. Have fun!</div>

    </div>

    <div class = 'Project 1'>Advanced Blackjack is the third project I worked on during my two years learning python. Similar to the previous project, this one was also built in the 'console' section. The purpose of this game is to be closer to 21 than the dealer, while not going over the limit of 21. The game repeats infinetly until the user stops the game. This was quite a unique game and I hope you enjoy playing it! </div>
