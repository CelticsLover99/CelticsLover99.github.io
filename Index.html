      <div class="About2">My name is Anuraag Dhaul, and I am currently 12 years old. I was born in New Delhi, India and lived there for the first six years of my life. After that, my family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands. In the Netherlands, I went to the Internation School of Amsterdam (ISA) and am now studying at The American School of the Hague. My hobbies are football, basketball, reading mystery novels. When I grow up, I want to be a businessman or a lawyer. I created this website to show you about my accomplishemnts and my goals in life.

  <div class="Scratch">
    <div class="IntroScratch">I first started coding by learning how to operate Scratch to build projects. With the help of Juni and my Juni instructor I mastered the motion, looks, sounds, events, controls, sensors, variables, and 'my blocks'. I learned scratch through the organized lessons of Juni and by viewing other scratchers' work on the main page. During the two years I spent learning scratch, I coded many projects. Some of these projects and and a short explanation of each one of them are below.</div>

    <div class="ScratchProject1">The first project is one of my master projects that I coded. A master project is a project which makes you code a game based on the skills you have learned during the course. This project is an interactive 2 v. 2 games based on soccer. The controls to move the sprites (characters) are below:
      Ben (sprite dressed in red and black): Arrow Key
      Hannah (sprite with brunnete hair, dressed in white tank top and blue baggy shorts): WASD keys
      Avery (sprite dressed in dark blue top and khaki cargo pants): IJKL keys
      Jordyn (sprite dressed in teel and pink soccer unifrom):TFGH keys

    <div class = "ScratchProject1">The second project I created during my time learning Scratch was a 'Person v. AI' game based around on Tennis. This game replays the match between Federer and Herbert (two major tennis champions). The controls are listed in the project page. Enjoy!
